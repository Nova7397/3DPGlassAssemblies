Create a dataset from your parametric model on grasshopper:

Steps:
1. Copy the python script as a component in grasshopper.
2. The input of the component is the geometry to be exported.
3. Edit the script based on the naming of the dataset preferred
4. Use Colibri to iterate over hte designs. (TIP: use multiple number sliders to filter designs/ select sampled designs fro the design space)
Please refer to Colibri documentation in order to automatically iterate over number sliders in grashopper.
